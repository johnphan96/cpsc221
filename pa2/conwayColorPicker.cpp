/**
 *  The function below returns either a black or a white HSLA pixels.
 *  The logic for determining whether a pixel is black or white is abstracted
 *  away in nextColor() which is given to you.
 * 
 *  However, nextColor() requires the number of WHITE pixels (representing dead cells)
 *  so your job here to figure out how to do an 8 point search around a pixel, eg
 *      NW  | North| NE
 *      West| (x,y)| East
 *      SW  | South| SE 
 *  All pixels around an initial (x,y) pixel
 * 
 *  HINT: in this filler, you will have to exploit and update the PNGmap field accordingly.
 *          it will also be useful if you look up the documentation for a C++ Map
